## Deep_Learning_Hub
Welcome to my Deep Learning Hub !! 

A big thanks to the Internet and social media that helped us generate huge amounts of data to explore with. Today, understanding deep learning is not limited to just universities but has become an integral part in running huge organisations and Multi-National companies.

I hope to add interesting projects and source codes in this repository

  # 1. Image Recognition in Keras 
  
   A Simple Digit Finder using Keras built on top of Tensorflow with MNIST Dataset.
      
  # 2. Cats and Dogs Classifier
  
   12501 images of Cats and Dogs each used to train in a Convolutional Neural Network. Visualizations on TensorBoard.
   
  # 3. Deep CNN on CIFAR-10 Dataset
  
   A deep Convolutional Neural Network is applied on CIFAR-10 Dataset of images having 10 classes.
   
  # 4. Vertical Edge Detector 
   
   A convolution applied on a real world image of 512x512 pixels image to detect Vertical Edges.
   
  # 5. Logistic Regression on a Single Neuron 
  
   A Neural Network from scratch is coded to implement the Forward and Backprop algorithms on CIFAR-10 Dataset.
